# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Recurrent-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-RCNN-and-Deep-Learning
Developed a forest fire detection model using RCNN to identify fire-prone areas in satellite images. Used deep learning for accurate fire region classification, enabling early alerts. Demonstrated skills in image processing, model training, and real-time detection using Python.
